                    Medium is a home for human stories and ideas. Here, anyone can share insightful perspectives,
                    useful knowledge, and life wisdom with the world—without building a mailing list or a following
                    first.
                    The internet is noisy and chaotic; Medium is quiet yet full of insight. Its simple, beautiful,
                    collaborative, and helps you find the right audience for whatever you have to say.

                    Over 100 million people connect and share their wisdom on Medium every month. Many are
                    professional writers, but just as many aren’t — they’re CEOs, computer scientists, U.S.
                    presidents, amateur novelists, and anyone burning with a story they need to get out into the
                    world. They write about what they’re working on, what’s keeping them up at night, what they’ve
                    lived through, and what they’ve learned that the rest of us might want to know too.


                    Instead of selling ads or selling your data, we’re supported by a growing community of Medium
                    members who align with our mission. If you’re new here, start exploring. Dive deeper into
                    whatever matters to you. Find a post that helps you learn something new, or reconsider something
                    familiar—and then share your own story.
